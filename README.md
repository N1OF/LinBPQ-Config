# LinBPQ-Config
Sample bpq32.cfg file for Winlink Node and Chat Node via LinBPQ software on Linux

I had fought with this software for several weeks, but I have successfully created a bpq32.cfg file for LinBPQ that will allow you to run a 1200 Baud AX.25 Packet Node serving Winlink clients, as well as hosting a Packet Chatroom. Please feel free to redistribute and edit as you'd like.
