# LinBPQ-Config
Sample bpq32.cfg file for Winlink Node, BBS Node, and Chat Node via LinBPQ software on Linux

I had fought with this software for several weeks, but I have successfully created a bpq32.cfg file for LinBPQ that will allow you to run a 1200 Baud AX.25 Packet Node serving Winlink clients, as well as hosting a Packet Chatroom and Bulletin Board System. Please feel free to redistribute and edit as you'd like.

This assumes you are using a software TNC such as Direwolf with a KISS TNC port.

_Update 05/26/2025: I have added BBS capabilities to this basic config_
